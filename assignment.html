        <dt><strong>HTML</strong></dt>
        <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the core language of the web, used to structure and format content such as text, images, and links. It employs tags to define elements, allowing browsers to interpret and display web pages accurately. HTML forms the foundation for building and presenting information on the internet.</dd>

        <dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
        <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a vital web technology that enhances the visual presentation of HTML elements. By applying styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts, CSS creates appealing and consistent designs across web pages. It separates content from presentation, enabling efficient and flexible control over the appearance of a website.</dd>
    
        <dt><strong>Javascript</strong></dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language used in web development to add interactivity and functionality to websites. It allows manipulation of HTML and CSS, enabling real-time updates, animations, and user interactions. As a client-side language, JavaScript runs directly in browsers, enhancing the user experience and making web pages more engaging and responsive.</dd>

        <dt><strong>React</strong></dt>
        <dd>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces in web applications. It enables the creation of modular, reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on data changes. By providing a virtual DOM and one-way data flow, React enhances performance and simplifies the development of interactive and responsive user experiences.</dd>
        
        <dt><strong>Angular</strong></dt>
        <dd>Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework for developing dynamic web applications. Built with TypeScript, it enables the creation of structured and modular components that manage data, UI, and logic. With features like two-way data binding and dependency injection, Angular simplifies complex tasks, streamlining the process of building robust and feature-rich single-page applications.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Vue</strong></dt>
        <dd>Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It empowers developers to create interactive and adaptable web applications through its component-based architecture. Vue's simplicity and flexibility make it easy to integrate with existing projects or build from scratch, enabling seamless development and maintenance of dynamic user experiences.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Wireframe</strong></dt>
            <dd>A wireframe in product design is a basic visual representation outlining the layout and structure of a digital interface or application. It serves as a blueprint, focusing on content placement and user interactions, aiding designers and stakeholders in early-stage concept validation and refining the user experience.</dd>
    
            <dt><strong>Lo Fi</strong></dt>
            <dd>In product design, "lo-fi" (short for low-fidelity) refers to creating rough and basic prototypes or mockups that capture key elements and interactions of a design concept. These simplified representations help designers iterate quickly, gather feedback, and test ideas before committing to detailed designs, allowing for efficient exploration and refinement of concepts.</dd>
    
            <dt><strong>Prototyping</strong></dt>
            <dd>Prototyping in product design involves creating a preliminary model or representation of a product or system to test and validate design concepts. Prototypes can be physical or digital and serve as tangible examples for stakeholders to interact with, helping to identify potential issues, refine features, and enhance user experiences before moving on to full-scale development.</dd>
    
            <dt><strong>Interaction Design</strong></dt>
            <dd>Interaction design in product design focuses on shaping the way users engage with a product or system. It encompasses designing intuitive and meaningful user interfaces, seamless navigation, and engaging user experiences. By considering user behaviors, needs, and expectations, interaction design aims to create interfaces that are user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and product usability.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Hi Fi</strong></dt>
            <dd>In product design, "hi-fi" (short for high-fidelity) refers to creating polished and detailed prototypes that closely resemble the final product's appearance and functionality. These advanced representations enable designers to simulate realistic user interactions and test intricate features, providing a comprehensive preview of the end-user experience and aiding in refining design elements before actual development.</dd>
